# SNS
Tasks I have done  during the apprenticeship in this subject SNS, which one is based on machine learning.
You can find examples of all the models I have learnt, and also metrics,ways of how to manage data to train the models, even the methods we use to build a new data from others data, in other words all the process from the beginning where you prepare and analyze the data until you train the model and get a prediction and the accuracy.
